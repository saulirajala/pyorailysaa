This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Things to do:
1. Add splash screen to ask city and +7h weather using React Router
    * if there is ?place=city in URL, skip splash screen
2. Enable prettier
3. Write some tests
4. Move to styled components or Glamorous
5. Do something with Redux (maybe that +7h weather actually is more of Redux job than Router)
6. Code splitting
7. Progressive Web App
